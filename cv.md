1. I want to thoroughly study everything that is necessary for a good *front-end developer*. My goal for a start is to get the necessary skills for a *junior front-end developer* position. I am ready to constantly learn new technologies and necessary skills for programming in order to become a *senior front-end developer* someday. I am purposeful and responsible, friendly and always ready to help.
